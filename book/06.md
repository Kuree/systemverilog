# Test Benches and UVM
A significant portion of the language are dedicated to test benches and testing. In this chapter we will cover some commonly used techniques to write efficient test bench for your hardware designs.

## Timing Controls
Timing is one of the most important factor to consider when writing a test bench. Should the signal be stable before the clock edge, or how long should the signal be valid for? What does delay mean? This section will cover various aspect of timing controls.
