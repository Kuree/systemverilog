# Simulation and Test Benches
A significant portion of the language are dedicated to test benches and testing. In this chapter we will cover some commonly used techniques to write efficient test bench for your hardware designs.

## How SystemVerilog Simulator Works
Before we delve into details of how to write a proper test bench, we need to establish a deep understanding of how simulator works and how it schedules events. This will help us troubleshoot bugs and errors in the future.

A specification-compliant SystemVerilog simulator follows a discrete event execution model, where the simulation time advances with value updates. The hardware design is inherently parallel, where processes such as `always_comb` and `always_ff` are executed currently. Each time the value of a net/variable changes, we will have an *update event* and any processes that are sensitive to that event need to be evaluated as well, which is called *evaluation event*. At each "timestamp", the simulator needs to first compute the update events, evaluate update events, and loop back to see if there is more update events triggered by previous update events.

The term for "timestamp" in SystemVerilog is *simulation time*. It can be transformed back to real time using the `timescale` compiler directive introduced earlier in the book. We use simulation time, or simply time throughout the entire chapter to avoid confusion.

Although the design and test bench is parallel by nature, most simulators are single-threaded and follows certain rules to evaluate the code to ensure it is conceptually correct. Typically the simulator divides the unit time slop into multiple regions where events can be scheduled in a pre-defined orders. In each region, the events can be scheduled arbitrarily, allowing simulator performs optimization when it sees fit. Figure @fig:sim_diagram shows how the time slot is divided into different regions and the execution flow between different regions.

PLI regions will be discussed in much details later in the book. For now it is enough to know there are regions reserved for third-party libraries that can be loaded into the simulator and can have direct access to the simulator state.

Fully cover each region requires much lengthy details and readers are encouraged to read through the language LRM and even try to implement a simple interpreter-based simulator. We will focus on three major regions: active event region, inactive events region, and NBA events region.

Generally speaking, any events (e.g. blocking assignment) specified in the `always_comb` and continuous assignment are evaluated in the active event region. The simulator continues evaluate the events in the active event region in a loop until no events left in the region. If there is an explicit timing control, e.g. #0 delay control, in the process, the process will be suspended and the following events are scheduled into the inactive events region. Again, the simulator runs in loop to clear out the events in the inactive events region.

The NBA events region contains nonblocking assignment update. It will only be executed after precedent active and inactive region are cleared.

### Simulation order
The SystemVerilog LRM guarantees a certain scheduling order. Any simulator claims to be standard compliant should obey the execution order:

1. Statements within a `begin`-`end` block shall be executed in lexical order, i.e., the order in whey they appear in the source code
2. NBAs shall be performed in the order the statement where executed.

To understand the second requirement, let's consider the following example:

```SystemVerilog

logic a;
initial begin
    a <= 0;
    a <= 1;
end
```

At the end of simulation time, variable `a` will be first assign to 0, and then 1.

As one can suspect, such ordering poses a hard restriction on reordering-related compiler optimization. Simulation vendors typically employ different types of optimization to ensure the semantics is met, but necessary the actual ordering of execution. For instance, if no third-party entity is expected to read out the exact simulation order (e.g. debugger that allows step through), we can reorder the statements as long as it is side-effects free and matches the ordering semantics. This significantly speeds up the simulation but requires extra flags if users wish to debug and step through the code, e.g. `-line_debug` flag in Xcelium. Verilator, on the other hand, only offers reordered simulation order for the sake of performance. As a result, it is not standard compliant.

The SystemVerilog LRM, however, does not specify the ordering at which processes are evaluated. As a result, it is up to the simulator to decide which process to execute first. This introduce nondeterminism among the simulators. Another source of nondeterminism comes from the fact that simulator may suspend the process and place partially completed events as pending event in the event region whenever it
encounters a timing control statement. This typically happens in the test bench instead of the RTL design, since synthesizable RTL disallows timing control except for `always_ff`.

## Timing Controls
Timing is one of the most important factor to consider when writing a test bench. Should the signal be stable before the clock edge, or how long should the signal be valid for? What does delay mean? This section will cover various aspect of timing controls.

The compiler directive ``timescale` specifies the precision at which the simulator should run. Since different modules may have different timescale, the simulator needs to make a decision on how to represent simulation time. In most simulators, in fact any simulator that supports VPI standard (discussed later), simulation time is represented as an unsigned 64-bit integer, even though the RTL model may expect the time to be a float. To do so, time is rounded off to the specified precision and then scaled to the simulation time units. Consider the following example:

```SystemVerilog
`timescale 1ns/10ps
module A;
logic a;
initial begin
    #1.2 a = 1;
end
endmodule

`timescale 1us/10ns

module B;
logic b;
initial begin
    #3.4 b = 1;
end
endmodule
```

For all modules, 10ps is the finest precision so 1 simulation time unit corresponds to 10ps. Before we convert every delay into the simulation time, we first round the delay into module's precision. So 1.2 in module `A` becomes $1.2ns = 120 \times 10ps$, i.e. 120 10-picoseconds unit; 3.4 in module `B` becomes $3.4us = 340 \times 10us$, i.e. 340 10-microseconds. Then we scale everything into simulation time. Hence 1.2 in module `A` becomes 120 10-picoseconds and 3.4 in module `B` becomes 340000 10-picoseconds.

To obtain the simulation time, we can use `$time`, which can be printed out either via `%d` or `%t` in the `$display` function.

The most common usage of timing control is setting the clock. A standard code style is shown below:

```SystemVerilog
module top;
logic clk;

initial clk = 0;
always clk = #10 ~clk;

endmodule
```

Notice that the clock changes its value every 10 units of time, hence the clock period is 20 units of time. Because this `always` block runs forever, we have to terminate the simulation with the builtin SystemVerilog task `$finish`, as shown below:

```SystemVerilog
initial begin
    // test bench logic

    $finish;
end
```

To synchronize the values against the clock, we highly discourage readers to set delays by hand, which is error-prone and reduce the readability. Instead, we recommend to use timing controls (`@`) directly. Here is an example:

```SystemVerilog
initial begin
    input1 = 1;
    input2 = 2;

    @(posedge clk);

    input1 = 2;
    input2 = 3;

    @(posedge clk);
end
```

In such way, we are guaranteed that signals `input1` and `input2` are set before the rising edge of the clock signal, regardless of the clock period! If you have checking/assertion logics, you can place them after the negative edge of the clock, assuming there is no synchronous logic depends on negative edge of the clock in your design (dual triggering typically happens in some high-performance design), as shown below:

```SystemVerilog
initial begin
    // input logic
    input1 = 1;
    @posedge (clk);
    @negedge (clk);
    // checking logic
    assert(output1 == 1);
    // input logic
    input1 = 2;
    @posedge (clk);
    @negedge (clk);
    // checking logic
    assert(output1 == 2);
    //...
end
```

We will discuss more complex but reusable test bench design pattern later in the chapter.

### Fork and Join
Because hardware is inherently concurrent, in many cases we want to have multiple threads performing tasks at the same time, either driving or checking differently parts of the design. SystemVerilog offers fork and join semantics that is similar to that of software programming languages, e.g. `std::thread` in C++.

The general syntax for `fork` and `join` is shown below. Notice that each statement inside the `fork` `join` is an individual thread, so if you want complex logic, you need to enclose it with `begin` and `end` block.

```SystemVerilog
fork
    // thread 1
    // thread 2
    // thread 3
join
```

Here is a simple example to illustrate how to use `fork` and `join`:

```SystemVerilog
module fork_join_ex;
    initial begin
        fork
            #10 $display("Thread 1 finished at %t", $time);
            begin
                // thread 2
                #5 $display("Thread 2 finished at %t", $time);
            end
            #20 $display("Thread 3 finished at %t", $time);
        join
    end
endmodule
```

Run the file (`code/06/fork_join_ex.sv`) with `xrun` we will get:

```
Thread 2 finished at                    5
Thread 1 finished at                   10
Thread 3 finished at                   20
```

Notice that you can even have nested `fork` `join`, i.e. one thread can spawn multiple threads as well. Although the fork join semantics is similar to software programming languages, there are some properties we need to keep in mind:

1. All statements are executed concurrently, regardless of whether it is simulated on a single CPU core or not.
2. Timing controls are local to each fork block and are computed relative to the simulation time when entering the block.
3. It is always a good practice to name the fork block, especially when you're creating variables inside, as shown below:
   ```SystemVerilog
   fork
      begin: blk_1
          // logic
      end: blk_1
      begin: blk_2
          // logic
      end: blk_2
    join
   ```
4. Since fork and join is part of SystemVerilog's timing control, it is not allowed inside `function`. You need to use `task` instead.
5. Any objects declared inside the fork-join block are managed by the simulator, so we don't need to worry about dangling references or memory leaks. However, they should be declared as `automatic` so that it is local to the block.
6. You cannot put fork-join inside `always_comb`.

#### Different Join Semantics
There are three different join keywords we can use in SystemVerilog and each have different semantics:

- `join`: this keyword blocks the execution until all the forked processes finish, This is similar to `join()` in software threads
- `join_any`: this keyword blocks until any of the forked processes finishes. As a result, some processes may still be running when the execution of the main thread continues
- `join_none`: this keyword does not block and execution as the forked processes continue to execute in the background.

## Standard Data Structures
SystemVerilog introduces many common data structures to help designers build complex test logic. These data structure interfaces are heavily influenced by C++ standard libraries. We will take a quick look at some commonly used data structures. Interested readers should refer to LRM for more information. Keep in mind that all the data structures introduced in this sub-chapter is not synthesizable, as with any construct discussed in this chapter.

### Dynamic Array
Most arrays in SystemVerilog are fix-sized and their dimensions cannot be changed at run time. Dynamic array, as its name suggests, is an *unpacked* array whose dimension can be changed at runtime. To decare a dynamic array we can use the following syntax

```SystemVerilog
    // data_type name[];
    integer a[];
    logic[15:0] b[];
```

You can also combine it with other arrays, as shown below, which declares a fix-sized array of dynamic arrays.

```SystemVerilog
    integer a[1:0][];
```

To initialize the dynamic array, we can use the keyword `new` with the targeted dimension:

```SystemVerilog
    integer a[];
    a = new[10];
```

Keep in mind that even though we have initialized the dynamic array, the content of each array element is still uninitialized. As a result, you can get `x` when reading the element values.

To loop through the array, we can simply do

```SystemVerilog
integer a[];
a = new[4];
foreach (a[i]) begin
    $display("a[%0d] = %0d", i, a[i]);
end
```

Notice that we implicitly create an index variable `i` with the `foreach` keyword.

Below is a list of methods associated with the dynamic array:

- `size()`: in additional to the standard system call function `$size()`, dynamic array has a method that returns the size of the array.
- `delete()`: clears all the elements and becomes an empty array.

### Queue
Queue is SystemVerilog's equivalence for vector in C++. To declare a queue, we can use the following syntax:

```SystemVerilog
// type name[$];
string names[$];
integer values[$];
```

Like normal arrays, queue supports slicing operations:
- Like the usual slicing operator, the indexing is inclusive, that is, `queue[a:b]` should returns `b - a + 1` elements.
- If the slicing is out of range or malformed, e.g., `queue[1:0]`, an empty queue should be returned.
- If any 4-state value containing `x` or `z` is used for slicing, an empty queue should be returned.

Looping through the queue is the same as looping through dynamic arrays:

```SystemVerilog
integer a[$];
foreach (a[i]) begin
    $display("a[%0d] = %d", i, a[i]);
end
```

Below is a list of methods associated with the queue:
- `size()`: in additional to the standard system call function `$size()`, `size()` returns the size of the queue.
- `delete(index)`: deletes the element based on given index; if index is not provided as a function argument, clear the queue.
- `insert(index, value)`: insert the `value` into given `index`.
- `push_back(value)`: put the element to the end of the queue.
- `pop_back()`: removes and returns the last element of the queue. If the queue is empty, default value for the data type is returned and a warning may be issued.
- `push_front(value)`: put the element to the front of the queue.
- `pop_front()`: removes and returns the first element of the queue. If the queue is empty, default value for the data type is returned and a warning may be issued.

### Associative Array
Associative array is SystemVerilog's equivalence for map containers in C++. The index expression can be any legal SystemVerilog type and the size of the container grows as more elements are inserted. To declare an associative array, we can use the following syntax:

```SystemVerilog
// data_type name [index_type]
integer array1[string];
logic[15:0] array2[ClassA]; // ClassA is a class
// * implies any integral expression of any size
// more details below
logic array3[*];
```

SystemVerilog supports using `*` as a wildcard for index type with the following restrictions:

1. The index type must be an integral type, but can be different size. The "true value" is used for indexing; that is, SystemVerilog needs to resolve two values with different sizes to the same index location if their values match.
2. 4-state values with `x` and `z` is illegal.
3. Non-integral index types/values are illegal and will result in an error
4. String can be used, but will be casted as integral values.

To initialize the associative map when declaring it, we can use the following syntax:

```SystemVerilog
string map[integer] = {0: "a", 1: "b"};
```

Similar to other data structures, we can loop through the associative array using `foreach` keyword:

```SystemVerilog
string map[integer] = {0: "a", 1: "b"};
foreach (map[key]) begin
    string value = map[key];
end
```

Below is a list of useful methods for associative array:
- `size()`: in additional to the standard system call function `$size()`, `size()` returns the number of elements in the associative array.
- `delete([index])`: if index is provided, deletes the index and its associated value from the array. If index is not provided as function argument, clear the entire array.
- `exists(index)`: returns 1 if the element with given index exists and 0 otherwise.

## Event Control and Synchronization
Because the programming model lof a standard RTL test bench requires concurrency and therefore synchronization, SystemVerilog offers various constructs and keywords to help programmers reason about the concurrency.

The basic synchronization unit is event, which can be either named or unnamed. An unnamed event is created implicitly through detecting the values changes on nets and variables. There are three types of value changes that can trigger an event:

- `posedge`: it happens when the net become non-zero from zero or from `x/z` to 1, , e.g. `0 -> 1` or `0 -> x`
- `negedge`: it happens when the net becomes non-one from one or from `x/z` to 0, e.g. `1 -> 0` or `1 -> x`
- `edge`: it happens whenever `posedge` or `negedge` happens.

Only integral values or strings can be used in the implicit event. 

To synchronize the logic with *edge-triggered* events, we need to use `@` keyword as shown below. Notice that we have seen the event control in `always_ff` and previous sections on how to write a simple test bench!

```SystemVerilog
@(posedge clk);
@(negedge ckl);
```

Events can also be OR-ed together so that the code can be synchronized by any of the events, as shown below:

```SystemVerilog
@(posedge clk or posedge clk2);
```

Notice that SystemVerilog also offers a syntax sugar that uses comma (`,`) as OR operator in the events, which we have seen in the `always_ff` earlier:

```SystemVerilog
always_ff @(posedge clk, negedge rst_n);
```

Another way to synchronize events is blocking the execution until a condition becomes true. This is called *level-sensitive*, as oppose to edge-sensitive in the case of using `@`. To do so, we need the `wait` keyword, which evaluates a specified condition. If the condition is false, the following procedure statement shall be blocked until that condition becomes true. Below shows an example (`code/06/wait_ex.sv`) of `wait` with `fork`:

```SystemVerilog
module wait_ex;
logic a;

initial begin
    fork
        begin
            #10;
            a = 1;
        end
        begin
            wait(a);
            $display("@(%0t) a = %d", $time, a);
        end
    join
end
endmodule
```

After running the example we will see the following printout, which is expected.

```
@(10) a = 1
```

Although `@` and `wait` seems similar, they are fundamentally different since one is edge-triggered and the other is level-triggered. One direct implication of this is they are scheduled differently in the simulator. 


A named event can be constructed through the builtin type in SystemVerilog, `event`, which allows aliasing, as shown bellow.

```SystemVerilog
event e1;       // declare a new event called e1
event e2 = e1;  // e2 becomes an alias of e1
event e3 = null; // event e3 does not hold any synchronization object
```

To trigger a named event, we can use `->` and `->>`. `->>` is the non-blocking version of `->`. To wait for an event to be triggered, we can use `triggered` with `wait` keyword, as shown below.

```SystemVerilog
module event_trigger_ex;
event e;

initial begin
    fork
        begin
            #10;
            -> e;
        end
        begin
            wait(e.triggered);
            $display("@(%0t) e is triggered", $time);
        end
    join
end
endmodule
```

We should expect similar output as the `wait` example:

```
@(10) e is triggered
```

There are several advantages of using events compared to using normal signals

- Events can be passed into tasks and other hierarchy due to its aliasing semantics.
- Events avoid a common case of race condition. Considering the following example:
  ```SystemVerilog
  wait (a);
  wait (e.triggered)
  ```
  If the simulator evaluates the `wait` statement and updating `a` value at the same time, the ordering of execution is undetermined since this is a race condition. Using `triggered` however, is guaranteed to be executed properly, regardless of the ordering of execution.
