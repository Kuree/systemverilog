# Common Design Practices
The end goal of RTL design, especially for ASIC, is to produce smallest and fastest circuit possible. To do so, we need to understand how synthesis tools analyze and optimize the design. In addition, we are also concerned about the simulation speed, since waiting tests to run is effectively wasting engineering efforts. Although synthesis and simulation tools have numerous optimization passes and transformations, one important factor for the end result is the design pattern, i.e., do the code follow the tool's design guide. Lots of optimization are tuned for a particular design pattern, making the code easier to to be understood and thus simplified by the tools. In addition, some design patterns may simplify the code structures and make the code more readable and reusable.

In this chapter we will go through some common design practices and how we should program the logic and structure the source code.

## Compiler Directives and Packages
Similar to C/C++, SystemVerilog defines a preprocessing stage where macros are expanded in the original source code. The compiler directives are not turing-complete and less versatile than that of C/C++,meaning even fix-bounded recursive computation is difficult to be specified in SystemVerilog. Nevertheless, it allows some level of preprocessing in SystemVerilog.


### Compiler Directives
There are several compiler directives defined by the language. We will cover some of the most used macros here:

1. `` `__FILE__``
2. `` `__LINE__``
3. `` `define``
4. `` `else``
5. `` `elseif``
6. `` `ifdef``
7. `` `ifndef``
8. `` `endif``
8. `` `undef``
10. `` `timescale``
11. `` `include``

`` `__FILE__`` and `` `__LINE__`` are used the same way as `__FILE__` and `__LINE__` in C/C++. Users can use that for test bench debugging. During preprocessing, these two compiler directives will be replaced with the actually file name and line number.

`` `define`` allows you to define macros, which can be used later in the code. We will show two examples where the first one defines values, and the second one define function-like code snippets, which takes arguments. Notice that unlike C/C++, macros have to be prefixed with `` ` `` when used in code.

```SystemVerilog
`define VALUE 10

module top (input logic clk);

logic [31:0] a;

always_ff @(posedge clk)
    a <= `VALUE;

endmodule
```

In the example above, we define `` `VALUE`` to be 10, and used it as register value. Even though we cover the usage here, please avoid defining constant values as macros in such way. It is because:

1. It is difficult to find where the macro is defined, e.g. either from a file or command line options
2. There is no namespace regarding macro values. If there are two macros shares the same name, whichever gets parsed later will be used. This may cause unexpected bugs that is difficult to debug, since the compiler may not issue warning for macro re-definition.

We highly recommend to use define constants in a package, which will be covered later in this chapter.

Another way to use `` `define`` is to define some code snippets which can be re-used later, as shown in the example below (also in `code/04/macros_arguments.sv`):

```SystemVerilog
`define REGISTER(NAME, WIDTH, VALUE, CLK) \
    logic [WIDTH-1:0] NAME;               \
    always_ff @(posedge CLK) begin        \
        NAME <= VALUE;                    \
    end

module top;

logic        clk;
logic [15:0] in;

// declare 3 registers that are pipelined to signal in, in sequence
`REGISTER(reg1, 16, in,   clk)
`REGISTER(reg2, 16, reg1, clk)
`REGISTER(reg3, 16, reg2, clk)

// set the clock to 0 at time = 0, then tick the clock every 2 unit of time
initial clk = 0;
always clk = #2 ~clk;

initial begin
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) begin
        in = i;
        // wait for a cycle
        #4;
        // print out the register value
        $display("reg1: %d reg2: %d reg3: %d", reg1, reg2, reg3);
    end
    $finish;
end

endmodule
```

We will see the expected output, where `x` denotes uninitialized register value:
```
reg1:     0 reg2:     x reg3:     x
reg1:     1 reg2:     0 reg3:     x
reg1:     2 reg2:     1 reg3:     0
```

In the code example above, we first define three registers that are pipelined to signal `in` (in chained fashion). The macro `REGISTER` first defines the register given `NAME` and `WIDTH`, then it instantiate an `always_ff` block and assign the `VALUE` to the register as every clock cycle. Notice that we have to use `\` for multi-line definitions.

Although sometimes using a macro may save time and make the code more reusable, it is important to find a balance between repetitive code segments and macro usage. Keep in mind that macro is substituted during preprocessing stage, it will make source-code level debugging challenging. You also need to be careful about macro re-definition since all the macros are in global namespace.

During the macro definition, sometimes you need to undefine some macro names for a different usage. Similar to C/C++, you can use `` `undef`` to un-define the macro.

`` `ifdef`` and `` `ifndef`` can be used to test whether certain macro has been defined (or not defined). You need to close the compiler directives with `` `endif``. You can also add `` `else`` and`` `elseif`` to account for different scenarios. Notice that for a header file, they can be used together with `` `define`` to provide an include guard, which allows the header file to be included in multiple places. Their usages are identical to those of C/C++, so we will not cover them here.

`` `timescale`` is an important compiler directive useful to simulators. It specifies the unit of measurement for time and precision of time in specific design elements. There can be only be at most *one* timescale defined for any compilation-unit scope. In other words, it is illegal to define timescales at two different source files compiled together. The syntax for `` `timescale`` is shown below:

```SystemVerilog
// general syntax
`timescale time_unit / time_precision
// e.g.
`timescale 1ns / 1ps
`timescale 1ns / 1ns
```

The `time_unit` argument specifies the unit of measurement time and delays, and the `time_precision` argument specifies how delay values are rounded before used in simulation. `time_precision` should be at least as precise as `time_unit`, since `time_precision` is used for finer precision of simulation. The unit of `time_unit` and `time_precision` can be `s`, `ms`, `us`, `ns`, `ps`, and `fs`. The integer part specifies an order of magnitude for the size of the value, in other words, the only valid number is `1`, `10`, and `100`.

Timescale is crucial to simulate jittering and timing violation. It is also required for any power-related analysis. It is highly recommend to include timescale in your top-level test bench, even though it is not used.

`` `include`` serves the same purpose as `#include` in C/C++, where it includes definitions from another file. It's highly recommended to provide an include guard to the include file. If the filename is enclosed in quotes, e.g. `` `include "filename.svh"``, the compiler will first search its current working directory, and then search any user-specified locations. If the filename is enclosed in angle brackets, e.g. `` `include <filename.svh>``, the filename has to be files defined by language standard. This rule is similar to that of C/C++.

### Packages
Although `` `include`` provides a way for designers to share definitions, the compiler directives essentially asks the compiler to copy the content of included file into the source file, which is a legacy feature influenced by C. As modern programming languages start to use modules/packages to structure the source code, e.g. module in C++20, SystemVerilog introduce a construct called `package` that allows 
designers to reuse definitions, interfaces, and functions. Since `package` is synthesizable, it is highly recommend to use it in both RTL and test benches. Here is an example of package:

```SystemVerilog
package my_def_pkg;

// local parameters
localparam VALUE = 42;

// struct
typedef struct {
    logic a;
    logic b;
} my_struct_t;

// enum
typedef enum logic { RED, GREEN } color_t;

// function
function logic and_op(logic a, logic b);
    return a & b;
endfunction

endpackage: my_def_pkg
```

Here is an incomplete list of constructs that are allowed inside a package:

1. parameter declaration, e.g. `parameter` and `localparam`
2. function declaration, e.g. automatic function
3. data declaration, e.g., struct and enum
4. DPI import and export
5. class declaration
6. package import declaration

Since `parameter` cannot be redefined in side a package, we highly recommend to use `localparam` in lieu of `parameter` since they are functionally identical in a `package`. In other words, `localparam` does not have the visibility restriction in a `package`.

#### Package Import

To use the package definition in other modules, we need to use `import` keyword to import definition. There are several ways to import contents of a package and we will cover two commonly used approaches here:

1. wildcard import. This is similar to Python's `from pkg_name import *`:
   ```SystemVerilog
   import my_def_pkg::*;
   ```
2. explicit import. This is similar to Python's `from pkg_name import class_name`:
   ```SystemVerilog
   import my_def_pkg::my_struct_t;
   ```

After importing, the identifiers (i.e. struct names or enum value names) can be used directly in the module. One thing to notice that there are several places where we can put package import. Depends on where the content of the package is used, there are two standard approaches to do so:

1. If the identifier is used for module port definition, the import needs to placed before port list:
   ```SystemVerilog
   module top
       import my_def_pkg::*;
       (input my_struct_t in);
    endmodule: top
   ```
2. Otherwise, we shall put the import inside the module:
   ```SystemVerilog
   module top;
       import my_def_pkg::*;
       my_struct_t a;
   endmodule: top
   ```

#### Import Packages within a Package
Like software programming languages, you can import a package content inside another package, and the "chained" imports can be visible to the consumer. Here is an example (`code/04/chained_packages.sv`) illustrates the package imports:

```SystemVerilog
package def1_pkg;
    typedef enum logic[1:0] {ADD, SUB, MULT, DIV} alu_opcode_t;
endpackage: def1_pkg

package def2_pkg;
    // import alu_opcode_t from def1_pkg
    import def1_pkg::alu_opcode_t;
    // define a new struct that include alu_opcode_t
    typedef struct {
        alu_opcode_t alu_opcode;
        logic[7:0] addr;
    } opcode_t;
endpackage: def2_pkg

module top;
    // alu_opcode_t is NOT accessible from def2_pkg
    // the next line is ILLEGAL
    // import def2_pkg::alu_opcode_t;
    import def2_pkg::*;

    opcode_t opcode;

endmodule: top
```

Notice unlike some software programming language such as Python, where the imported identifier is accessible as part of the new package, SystemVerilog prohibits such behavior. If you try to import `alu_opcode_t` from `def2_pkg`, you will get a recursive import error in the compiler.

#### Package Usage Caveats
Since the content of a package is scoped, when use wildcard import, there is a chance of naming conflict. A rule of thumb is that when a naming conflicts, always resort to explicit import. Some coding styles prohibit the usage of wildcard import, which make the code a little bit more verbose, but more readable and maintainable. The exact scoping rule is beyond of scope of this book, but interested user should refer to Table 26-1 in 1800-2017.

Another caveat is that packages have to be compiled before any module files that rely on them. One systematic way is to rely on build tools such as `make` to ensure the order of compilation. Another simple way to do is to put packages before other sources while supplying file names to the tools.

## Finite State Machines
Finite State Machine (FSM) is the core part of hardware control logic. How well the FSM is designed can directly impact the synthesis and verification effort, since these tools have somewhat restricted expectation of how a FSM should be written. Although the theory of FSM is beyond the scope of this book, we will try to cover as much as possible while going over the major topics regarding FSM.

### Moore and Mealy FSM
Generally speaking there are two types of FSM commonly used in hardware design, namely Moore and Mealy machine. Moore machine, named after Edward F. Moore, is a type of FSM whose output values are determined solely by its current state. On the other hand, Mealy machine, named after George H. Mealy, is a type of FSM whose output values are determined by its current state and the current inputs. To draw a formal distinction between Moore and Mealy machine, we can refer to the following mathematical notations.

- A finite set of states $S$
- An initial state $S_0$ such that $S_0 \in S$
- A finite input set $\Sigma$
- A finite output set $\Lambda$
- A state transition function $T: \Sigma \times S \rightarrow S$
- An output function $G$

For Moore machines, the output function is $G: S \rightarrow \Lambda$, whereas for Mealy machines, the output function is $G: \Sigma \times S \rightarrow \Lambda$. Although Moore and Mealy machine are mathematically equivalent, there is a major difference when represented as a state transition diagram, as shown in Figure @fig:moore-fsm-diagram and @fig:mealy-fsm-diagram, where both diagram describes the logic that counts consecutive ones and output 1 once the count reaches 2. As a notation, the label on edges in Moore machine represents the input values and the label on the node represents the output value. In Mealy machine, the label on the edge follows input/output notation.

![State transition diagram for Moore Machine.](images/04/moore_fsm_diagram.svg){#fig:moore-fsm-diagram}

![State transition diagram for Mealy Machine.](images/04/mealy_fsm_diagram.svg){#fig:mealy-fsm-diagram}


Due to such difference, we will see timing and area related difference when we design Moore and Mealy machines in SystemVerilog:
- To describe the same control logic, Moore machines tend to have more states than Mealy machines
- The output from a Moore machines tends to have one extra cycle delay compared to Mealy machines.

Choosing which type of machine to use usually depends on the control logic you are trying to model. Since Mealy machines can be used as Moore machine if inputs are ignored when computing the outputs, Mealy machines are more general. Although nothing prevents you mixing these two machines together, it is highly recommend to stick to one coding style so that tools can recognize your design easily.

### FSM State Encoding
There are several different ways to encode your states $S$, one-hot encoding, Gray encoding, and binary encoding. Given $|S| = N$:

- one-hot encoding implies that only one of its bits is set to `1` for a particular state. That means the total number of bits required to represent the states is $N$. The Hamming distance of this encoding is 2, meaning we have to flip 2 bits for a state transition.
- Gray encoding, named after Frank Gray, is a special encoding scheme that only requires $log2(N)$ bits to encode. In addition, its Hamming distance is designed to be 1, which means only one bit change is required to transit a state
- Binary encoding means the state value is assigned by its index in the states. As a result, it requires $log(N)$ to encode. Since each state transition may require flipping all bits, e.g., state 0 transits to state 3 for 2-bit state, its hamming distance is $O(N)$.

Each encoding has its own advantages. For instance, since only one bit is required to test the state variable, one-hot encoding allows smaller multiplexing logic, and Gary encoding allows low switching power, thus favorable for low-power design. The choice to choose which encoding is more of an engineering topic depends on the design needs. As a result, many synthesis tools offer ability to recode FSM states during synthesis automatically. As a result, designers can code the FSM in one encoding scheme and synthesize it in a different scheme. However, this also implies that the synthesized version of RTL is different from the original RTL where all the verification is done. As a result, some corner-case bugs may occur when the tools re-encode the FSM. In general we recommend the design team decides on an encoding scheme early on based on some engineering experiment result. Doing so ensures the consistency between synthesis and verification.

In SystemVerilog, we typically use `enum` to define states. Compared to old school methods such as `` `define`` and `localparam`, using `enum` allows type-checking from the compiler, which makes the code safer and easier to debug. Below are several examples using one-hot encoding, Gray encoding, and binary encoding.

```SystemVerilog
// on-hot encoding
typedef enum logic[3:0] {
    IDLE  = 4'b0001,
    READY = 4'b0010,
    BUSY  = 4'b0100,
    ERROR = 4'b1000
} hot_hot_state_t;

// Gray encoding
typedef enum logic[2:0] {
    RED    = 4'b00,
    GREEN  = 4'b01,
    BLUE   = 4'b11,
    YELLOW = 4'b10
} gray_state_t;

// binary encoding
typedef enum logic[1:0] {
    STAGE_0 = 2'd0,
    STAGE_1 = 2'd1,
    STAGE_2 = 2'd2,
    STAGE_3 = 2'd3
} binary_state_t;
```

### General FSM Structure
As indicated by the formal definition of FSM, we need to design two components of the FSM: state transition logic $T$ and output function $G$. However, since FSM needs to hold its state, we need another component that sequentially update the FSM state. As a result, a typical FSM always have three components, as shown in the Figure @fig:fsm_structure.

![General FSM structure for Moore and Mealy machine.](images/04/fsm_structure.svg){#fig:fsm_structure}

### One-, Two-, and Three-Block FSM Coding Style
Although there are three necessary components for an FSM, sometimes we can merge some components together into a single process. As a result, we have three popular FSM coding style, commonly referred as one-block, two-block, and three-block FSM coding style.

In the following subsections, we will use count consecutive one as an example to show different coding styles. The definition of all states is shown below as a SystemVerilog package.

```SystemVerilog
`ifndef COUNT_ONE_FSM_PKG
`define COUNT_ONE_FSM_PKG

package count_one_fsm_pkg;

typedef enum logic[1:0] {
    moore_state0,
    moore_state1,
    moore_state2
} moore_state_t;

typedef enum logic {
    mealy_state0,
    mealy_state1
} mealy_state_t;

endpackage
`endif // COUNT_ONE_FSM_PKG
```

#### Three-Block FSM Coding Style
Three-block FSM coding style is usually implemented as a Moore machine where:

1. One block is used to update `state` with `next_state`.
2. One block is used to determine `next_state` based on `state` and current inputs.
2. One block is used to compute output based on `state`.

The complete example of three-block FSM is shown below (`code/04/three_block_fsm_moore.sv`):

```SystemVerilog
module three_block_fsm_moore (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

import count_one_fsm_pkg::*;

moore_state_t state, next_state;

// block 1: state <- next_state
always_ff @(posedge clk, negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        state <= moore_state0;
    end
    else begin
        state <= next_state;
    end
end

// block 2: determine next_state
always_comb begin
    case (next_state)
        moore_state0: begin
            if (in) next_state = moore_state1;
            else next_state = moore_state0;
        end
        moore_state1: begin
            if (in) next_state = moore_state2;
            else next_state = moore_state0;
        end
        moore_state2: begin
            if (in) next_state = moore_state2;
            else next_state = moore_state0;
        end
        default: begin
            next_state = moore_state0;
        end
    endcase    
end

// block 3: determine output based on state
always_comb begin
    case (state)
        moore_state0: out = 0;
        moore_state1: out = 0;
        moore_state2: out = 1;
        default: out = 0; 
    endcase
end

endmodule: three_block_fsm_moore
```


#### Two-Block FSM Coding Style
Two-block FSM is usually implemented in Mealy machine where:
1. One block is used to update `state` with `next_state`.
2. One block is used to determine `next_state` and the outputs, based on `state` and current inputs.

The complete example of two-block FSM is shown below (`code/04/two_block_fsm_mealy.sv`):

```SystemVerilog
module two_block_fsm_mealy (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

import count_one_fsm_pkg::*;

mealy_state_t state, next_state;

// block 1: state <- next_state
always_ff @(posedge clk, negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        state <= mealy_state0;
    end
    else begin
        state <= next_state;
    end
end

// block 2: determine next_state and output
always_comb begin
    case (state)
        mealy_state0: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = mealy_state1;
                out = 0;
            end
            else begin
                next_state = mealy_state0;
                out = 0;
            end
        end
        mealy_state1: begin
            if (in) begin
                next_state = mealy_state1;
                out = 1;
            end
            else begin
                next_state = mealy_state0;
                out = 0;
            end
        end
    endcase
end

endmodule: two_block_fsm_mealy
```

Using Mealy machine based two-block FSM has the advantage that output can update whenever input changes without the need to wait for the next cycle. However, it makes the maintenance difficult. Since the next state logic and output are coded together, if we need to adjust the FSM, significant restructure may be needed in two-block style. It is up to the design team to decide which style to use.

#### One-Block FSM Coding Style
One-block merges all the blocks together. As a result, maintaining and debugging such FSM is very challenging and we highly discourage people to adopt such FSM style unless absolute necessary. However, for completeness, we will show the code example people so that readers can recognize such programming style in practice.

```SystemVerilog
module one_block_fsm_mealy (
    input logic clk,
    input logic rst_n,
    input logic in,
    output logic out
);

import count_one_fsm_pkg::*;

mealy_state_t state;

// one block: state update, next state, and output are in the same always_ff block
always_ff @(posedge clk, negedge rst_n) begin
    if (!rst_n) begin
        state <= mealy_state0;
    end
    else begin
        case (state)
            mealy_state0: begin
                if (in) begin
                    state <= mealy_state1;
                    out <= 0;
                end
                else begin
                    state <= mealy_state0;
                    out <= 0;
                end
            end
            mealy_state1: begin
                if (in) begin
                    state <= mealy_state1;
                    out <= 1;
                end
                else begin
                    state <= mealy_state0;
                    out <= 0;
                end
            end
            default: begin
                state <= mealy_state0;
                out <= 0;
            end
        endcase
    end
end

endmodule: one_block_fsm_mealy
```
