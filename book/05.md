# Class and Object-Oriented Programming
One of the biggest features introduced in SystemVerilog is the ability to write functional model in an object-oriented manner, i.e. using the `class` construct. Although `class` construct is not synthesizable unfortunately, `class` provides a more software-oriented approach to model hardware behavior for verification. SystemVerilog supports the following object-oriented programming (OOP) practice:
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

In addition to the normal OOP, SystemVerilog also allows type parametrization for the class (similar to templates in C++)

## Class Definition and Syntax
The syntax of class is similar to that of C++. The constructor is called `new` and unfortunately there is no function overloading. However, similar to Python, users can provide default arguments to allow different usage. Here is a simple example of `class`:

```SystemVerilog
class Node;
    Node next;

    // constructor
    function new();
        next = null;
    endfunction

endclass
```

Notice that like Java/Python, each instance of the object in SystemVerilog is a "reference" and there is no pointer type. Keyword `null` is used to denoted null reference. You will get null exceptions when you try to access members of a null object. We can enhance the `Node` constructor with default argument in such way that users can also pass in the next reference while constructing the object:

```SystemVerilog
function new(Node next_node=null);
    next = next_node;
endfunction
```

By default, every member declared in the class is public, meaning any code can modify the attributes or call the functions regardless of the scope. To add private access modifier, we can use `local` keyword. For instance, we can have:

```SystemVerilog
class Node;
    local Node next;

    function new(Node next_node=null);
        next = next_node;
    endfunction

    // local function
    local function foo();
    endfunction
endclass
```

To instantiate the object, we can use `new` keyword, similar to Java/C#. To access member attributes or function, we can either use their identifiers directly or use `this` keyword to avoid naming conflicts, similar to that of C++. Here is a complete example of single-linked-list that has proper access modifier:

```SystemVerilog
class Node;
    local Node next;

    function new(Node next_node=null);
        next = next_node;
    endfunction

    // local function
    local function foo();
    endfunction
endclass

class List:
    local Node head_;

    function new();
        head_ = null;
    endfunction

    function Node head();
        return head_;
    endfunction

    function add_node();
        Node new_node = new Node(next);
        next = new_node;
    endfunction

endclass
```
