# Types, Operator, and Expressions
Like ordinary software programming languages, SystemVerilog allows designers manipulate different types and data objects when modeling the hardware. Although bears much similarity to languages such as C/C++ (in fact SystemVerilog is influenced by them), SystemVerilog is a language to model hardware, which has different semantics than software programming models. This chapter explores the type system and associated operators in SystemVerilog.
